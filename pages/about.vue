					shore, the elegance of sea birds soaring over foamy water,
					and the allure of sunbeams glimmering on the back of a gray
					whale. Unwind and bask in the serene atmosphere of Rockaway
					Beach's picturesque cove. It's no surprise that this
					enchanting location lured a man from thousands of miles away
					to call it his home.

					Stalios Karagianis, born in Macedonia, Greece in 1886,
					boarded a ship named the Konstantinos at the age of twenty
					and embarked on a journey to America. After arriving in New
					York, he traveled across the country and settled in San
					Francisco, where he found various jobs, including working in
					a vegetable store, as a jitney driver, and on the Ocean
					Shore Railroad. His work on the railroad eventually led him
					to the breathtaking Pacifica coastside.

					As many immigrants coming to America did at the time,
					Karagianis americanized his name, changing it to Charles
					Gust. After a few years of working and saving, he sent for
					his wife, Anastasia, to join him. Together, they built a
					house in Daly City and raised four children. In 1927,
					Karagianis purchased a property on the water's edge at
					Rockaway Beach, where he established a business selling
					sandwiches, peanuts, and candy to fishermen and beachgoers.
					Tragedy struck when his business burnt down, but he rebuilt
					it and continued serving visitors. Despite another fire, he
					persisted and made Rockaway Beach his family's home.

					Charlie Gust's dining spot became one of the most unique and

					those who enjoy the stunning coast. The Gust family invites
					you to dine at their restaurant, wheredining is at its
					finest and pays tribute to the man who made Rockaway Beach
